# landing-page-project
INTRODUCTION:
In this project, I will be creating a web page layout from a design provided to me by The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills thus far in HTML, CSS, and using google and completed TOP lessons for reference if I find myself stuck. As I type this introduction, I have not yet started this project. Read further to see how the process went for me after it was completed.

REFLECTION:
I knew this project would be difficult, but this ended up being harder than I thought. The first two sections I struggled with the most. I felt pretty okay with my HTML, although having to go back and change quite a bit, it wasn't too difficult. I could probably clean it up a bit more. I need a lot more work and practice with CSS in particular. I don't yet feel confident in my strategy with grouping selectors and using flexbox. I might start my CSS lessons from the beginning. Overall, I got a really good look into my strengths and weaknesses.
